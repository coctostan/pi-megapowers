## 2026-02-22 — Done-phase action feedback

- Selecting an action from the done-phase menu (e.g., "Write changelog entry") now shows the active action in the dashboard: **Action: Write changelog** with a "Send any message to generate." instruction
- The status bar now reflects the active action: `📋 #014 done → Write changelog` instead of just `📋 #014 done`
- Previously, selecting an action showed no persistent feedback — only a transient notification that was easy to miss, leaving users at a blank prompt unsure what happened


## 2026-02-22 — Phase transition guidance

- After transitioning to a new phase, the notification now includes actionable guidance (e.g., "Transitioned to: spec. Send a message to write the spec.") instead of just the phase name
- The dashboard shows a persistent instruction line for every phase, so you always know what to do next — no more blank prompt with zero context
- Phases that already had detailed dashboard content (implement tasks, done-phase actions) are unaffected
Blocked by write policy — `CHANGELOG.md` is a source file, not writable during the done phase. The entry is saved at `.megapowers/plans/032-subagent-implementation-reliability/write-changelog.md` and is ready to paste:

## 2026-02-24 — Subagent tools: delegate plan tasks to child pi sessions

- Added **`subagent`** tool that spawns an isolated child pi session to work on a task description, returning an ID immediately so the parent session can continue other work while the subagent runs.
- Added **`subagent_status`** tool that returns the subagent's current state (`running`, `completed`, `failed`, `timed-out`), files changed, test pass/fail, and the full `jj diff` for review before squashing — nothing is merged automatically.
- Agent behavior is configurable via markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `model`, `tools`, `thinking`); three builtins ship out of the box: **`worker`** (implementation), **`scout`** (read-only research), **`reviewer`** (read-only code review). Custom agents in `.megapowers/agents/` override builtins.
- Plan tasks can declare **`[depends: N, M]`** annotations; `subagent` enforces all listed dependency tasks are completed before dispatching.
- During implement phase, child sessions run with the same TDD write guard as the parent session.
Saved with a unique name:

`.megapowers/plans/060-subagent-robustness/changelog-2026-02-24-subagent-robustness-release-notes.md`

If you want, I can also generate an “ultra-short” 3-bullet version for a top-level `CHANGELOG.md` summary block.
