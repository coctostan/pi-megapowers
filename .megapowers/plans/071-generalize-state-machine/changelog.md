## [2026-02-25] — Declarative workflow engine replaces hardcoded state machine

- Workflow logic (phases, transitions, gates, write policy) is now defined in declarative config objects rather than hardcoded conditionals spread across multiple files — adding a new workflow type requires only a single config file and one import line.
- Gate conditions (require artifact, no open questions, review approved, all tasks complete) are now individually composable and testable, making it easier to reason about what blocks a phase transition.
- Phase aliasing (e.g. bugfix's "reproduce" → "brainstorm", "diagnosis" → "spec") is driven by workflow config rather than hardcoded special-cases, so template and artifact resolution is consistent across all workflows.
- No behavioral changes for existing users — feature and bugfix workflows produce identical phase sequences and transition rules as before; all 644 passing tests continue to pass with no regressions.
